## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- ea7d986: - Fixed ESM module resolution by adding `.js` extensions to relative imports in source files

  This fixes `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` errors when using this package in ESM projects.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- f0d30a4: - Add property `helpers.registerView` - Helper can now be extended to additional views after initialization.
  - Add property `helpers.filter` - Returns a `Filter` instance using the currently registered view definitions

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- e85c260: Support both simple, namespaced and full view reference formats in helpers.
  Everywhere a view is passed, the following formats is not supported:
  - `<externalId>`: simple
  - `<space>__<externalId>`: namespaced
  - `<space>__<externalId>__<version>`: full

  Which of these types are provided through intellisense varies based on the provided schema type, and will be narrowed to unambigious permutations on the provided schema keys.

  **BREAKING**:
  - The `asId()` function now returns the reference in the full format
  - The `asDefinition()` function no longer narrows the `$.externalId` property of the returned view definition.
